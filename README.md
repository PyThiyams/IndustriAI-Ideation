## Problem Statement

### Objective
Develop an AI-powered platform that evaluates, prioritizes, and optimizes green finance investments. This platform will aid banks and financial institutions in allocating capital to impactful and sustainable projects by:

1. Scoring projects based on their sustainability impact.
2. Optimizing resource allocation across multiple projects to maximize ESG outcomes within budget constraints.
3. Predicting future risks associated with green investments.

### Track: **Sustainability, Finance, and Technology**

## Modules Overview

### 1. **Update Data**

The first module focuses on data collection and processing by integrating multiple APIs and data sources to gather information about:

- **Retail Companies**: Retrieved via Angel One API.
- **Startup Databases**: Accessed through API Sethu for MSMEs.
- **Government Projects**: Data from ministries.
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculated using the stock-indicators library for retail investment analysis.
- **Market Sentiments, News, and Statistics**: Obtained through the Finhub API.
- **Green Finance NGOs**: Data sourced from NGO Darpan.
- **Crowdfunded Projects**: Information gathered from Kickstarter.

The collected data will be:

- Continuously updated through TimescaleDB using continuous aggregation.
- Processed to include historical and ongoing projects.
- Leveraged for quarterly incremental learning of an XGBoost model to ensure the platform adapts to new data seamlessly.

### 2. **Analysis Module**

This module retrieves updated data to conduct parallel analysis for ongoing projects across five categories:

1. Private equity/startup projects
2. Publicly listed companies
3. NGO projects
4. Government projects
5. Crowdfunded individual projects

#### Analysis Steps

1. **Category-Based Risk Analysis**:
   - Assigns risk ratios (e.g., publicly listed companies are low risk; private equity is high risk).

2. **Sector Analysis**:
   - Evaluates sectors using climate, geographic, and other hard-to-trace metrics.
   - Identifies bullish sectors and their sentiment trends.

3. **Growth Composite Impact Metric (GCIM)**:
   - A composite score (out of 100) evaluating projects’:
     - Financial Metrics: Revenue growth, profit margins, GMV growth, etc.
     - Customer Metrics: Client retention and growth.
     - Impact Metrics: Societal and business contributions.
     - Team Performance: Productivity and decision-making.
     - Future Readiness: Strategic positioning.
   - Uses proportional growth scaling and weighted contributions to reflect both small- and large-scale improvements.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Multiple rounds of analysis based on unconventional data sources, such as moderated community feedback.

5. **Technical Analysis**:
   - Focus on retail green finance investments.
   - Proprietary investment conditions tested over 30 years of data with 75% accuracy, such as:
     - Bullish divergence.
     - EMA 5 crossing above EMA 13 and EMA 50.
     - RSI above 60.

The final output includes a comprehensive set of numerical data points and scores for each project.
